## Setup your own MkDocs

**Hosting**

Your docs can be hosted on readdocs,

**Option 1: Basic**
If you simply want to build a basic MkDocs static webpage follow the instructions here: [Setup mkdocs](https://mkdocs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#mkdocs).

**Option 2: Material Design Theme**

All material theme code was provided from the following repo: **[material theme link](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material)**.

If you want to build an MkDocs that's like this one follow the instructions below.
* `git clone https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material.git`
* go to `mkdocs.yml` 
  * comment out `repo_name` and `repo_url`
  * change the site name
* Follow [MkDocs documentation](https://mkdocs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) on how to add pages, serve, and deploy.
* Please don't remove any of the copyrights, a lot of hard work was put in by the theme developer.

## Advice

If deploying to *Github Pages* I'd reccomend cloning the repo, switching to the gh-pages branch, doing your work in there, and then just running the `mkdocs gh-deploy --clean` command. It builds, cleans, and pushes for you.

Using `mkdocs serve` gives you a perfect sense of what your documentation will look like. But fair warning when you do `mkdocs build` don't try testing it by just clicking the html files, the paths for all of the links only work when it's being loaded by a web server.
