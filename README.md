## Generating new content
Generating new pages or content with `MkDocs` is extremely easy.

Simply write up a document in markdown, copy it over to the `docs` directory:

```
project-folder
|
|-> docs
     |
     |-> <Place md file here>
```

<br>
<br>

And then add the file and the page name you would like to give it in your `project-folder/mkdocs.yml` tree as shown below:
```md
# Page tree
nav:
  - Page name: markdownFileName.md
  - Grouping of Pages:
    - Grouping page 1: extensions/file1.md
    - Grouping page 2: extensions/file2.md

```
You are now ready to build and deploy! \
Instructions for that can be found in the next section.

## Setup your own MkDocs

**Hosting**

All files are static, this means not only can you have your website hosted on a regular web server but as well as free solutions such as [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/) and [github-pages](https://pages.github.com/).

**Option 1: Basic** \
If you simply want to build a basic MkDocs static webpage follow the instructions here: [Setup mkdocs](https://mkdocs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#mkdocs).

<br> 

**Option 2: Material Design Theme** \
All material theme code was provided from the following repo: **[material theme link](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material)**.

If you want to build an MkDocs that's like this one follow the instructions below.
* `git clone https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material.git`
* go to `mkdocs.yml` 
  * comment out `repo_name` and `repo_url`
  * change the site name
* Follow [MkDocs documentation](https://mkdocs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) on how to add pages, serve, and deploy.
* Please don't remove any of the copyrights, a lot of hard work was put in by the theme developer.

## Advice

If deploying to *Github Pages* I'd reccomend cloning the repo, switching to the gh-pages branch, doing your work in there, and then just running the `mkdocs gh-deploy --clean` command. It builds, cleans, and pushes for you.

Using `mkdocs serve` gives you a perfect sense of what your documentation will look like. But fair warning when you do `mkdocs build` don't try testing it by just clicking the html files, the paths for all of the links only work when it's being loaded by a web server.
